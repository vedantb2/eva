 * Worker pool configuration for `@pierre/diffs`. Without a pool, syntax
 * highlighting and word-level diffing run synchronously on the main thread,
 * which is what made opening a large PR's Diffs tab block for seconds.
 *
 * The pool's own render options take precedence over the per-instance options
 * passed to `FileDiff`, so the theme and diff granularity live here as shared
 * constants and `ReviewableFileDiff` reads the same ones. Changing one in
 * isolation would silently restyle every diff.
