// Regression guard for commit f01123c18 ("unblock its arrow buttons").
//
// The lightbox takes pointer capture on its swipe surface to drive a 1:1 drag.
// Capture retargets the resulting `click` to the capturing container, so any
// button inside that surface stops firing unless the drag never starts for it.
// The opt-out is a `data-lightbox-control` marker that `onPointerDown` checks
// before capturing — so a control added without the marker is rendered, looks
// live, hovers, and does nothing. That failure is invisible in review, which
// is why the count is pinned here.
//
// Disk-read contract check (matching the suite's other *Contract tests): the
// component is a "use client" module pulling @eva/ui, Radix and motion, none of
// which load in the node test environment.
