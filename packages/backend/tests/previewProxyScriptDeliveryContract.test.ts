 * The generated proxy script embeds the vendored html2canvas bundle (~200 KB).

 * argument list too long", so every sandbox start failed with "Vercel preview
 * proxy failed to start on port 3000". The script must be delivered with the
 * file-write API, whose payload limits are far higher (the callback runner is
 * ~330 KB and ships that way).
