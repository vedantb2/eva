 * Owns the browser tab's identity: the favicon and the theme-color meta.
 *
 * Both are document-level state that no React tree owns, so mirroring the theme
 * and a live query onto them is a genuine external-system effect. Keeping one
 * component in charge means one writer for the icon href — a separate
 * theme-watcher and badge-watcher would fight over it.
 *
 * Only the SVG icon link is touched: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox prefer it over
 * the PNG and ICO siblings, while Safari ignores SVG favicons entirely and
 * keeps showing the plain PNG. Safari therefore sees neither the theme surface
 * nor the badge rather than breaking.
 *
 * Reads the same cached `countUnread` subscription as the sidebar rail badge,
 * so it inherits that query's optimistic updates and adds no extra server load.
 * Mounted above the auth gate so signed-out pages still get a themed icon,
 * which is why the query is skipped until Convex reports an identity.
 * Renders nothing.
