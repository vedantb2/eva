/**
 * Pill-vs-stacked decision for the composer chrome, measured off the committed
 * DOM: the pill's inner width is cached while the pill is on screen, and a
 * draft that no longer fits it opens the stacked composer.
 *
 * This is deliberately impure — it reads layout during render so the chrome
 * snaps in the same paint as the keystroke — so it opts out of React Compiler
 * on its own. It lives in its own module for exactly that reason: the opt-out
 * stays scoped to these few lines instead of costing `ComposerInputChrome`
 * (and everything it renders) its memoization. The hook still runs on every
 * render of the caller, so the caller compiles and behaves identically.
