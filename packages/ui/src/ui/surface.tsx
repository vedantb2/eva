/**
 * A panel with the standard card edge and one of four paddings.
 *
 * `Card` already owns this recipe, but it splits padding across Header /
 * Content / Footer — which is right for a titled card and wrong for the thirty
 * places that just need one padded box. Those all re-typed
 * `rounded-surface border border-border bg-card p-N` by hand, landing on two
 * radii and five paddings, and (since the edge moved into the shadow) drawing a
 * double border.
 *
 * Density is a prop rather than a `className` so the paddings stay a closed
 * set. Anything outside the set is a layout decision worth making deliberately,
 * and `className` still overrides when it genuinely is one.
