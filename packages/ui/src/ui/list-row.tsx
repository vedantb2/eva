/**
 * Apply to any interactive control nested inside a `<ListRow>` — a checkbox, a

 */

/**
 * The shell every selectable list row shares: surface, hairline, accent stripe,
 * hover, selected state, press feedback, and focus ring.
 *
 * Three rows had hand-rolled this — project, quick task, notification — and they
 * had drifted on every one of those: 200ms vs 150ms, `w-1` vs `w-[3px]`,
 * `inset-y-2` vs `inset-y-1.5`, press feedback present or absent. Side by side
 * they read as three components rather than three instances of one.
 *
 * ## Why a stretched overlay rather than a wrapping button
 *
 * The obvious shape — make the whole row a `<button>` — is unusable here,
 * because these rows embed their own controls: a selection checkbox, tooltip
 * triggers, a dismiss action. A button inside a button is invalid HTML, and the
 * inner control never receives its clicks. That is exactly why the existing rows
 * reached for `role="button" tabIndex={0}` on a div, which then needed a
 * hand-written `Enter`/`Space` key handler and an `if (e.detail === 0) return`
 * guard to stop that handler firing twice.
 *
 * So the row body stays a plain `<div>`, and a real `<button>`, `<a>`, or router
 * `<Link>` (via {@link ListRowProps.link}) is stretched across it at `z-1`.
 * The native element supplies the keyboard behaviour, the accessible role, and
 * — for anchors/links — middle-click and Cmd-click. Nested controls opt above
 * the overlay with {@link LIST_ROW_CONTROL_CLASS}.
 *
 * Prefer {@link ListRowProps.link} with a router `<Link>` for in-app paths so
 * the router's `rewrite` owns the address-bar href. Use {@link ListRowProps.href}
 * only for external URLs (or when no router is available).
 *
 * The focus ring is drawn by the row, not the overlay. Rows clip their
 * decoration with `overflow-hidden` and a ring is a box-shadow, so a ring on the
 * overlay would be clipped away and keyboard focus would be invisible. The
 * `has-[…]` selector is scoped to the overlay's `data-slot` so a focused nested
 * control does not also light up the whole row.
 *
 * ## Why it forwards a ref and spreads the rest
 *
 * Rows are the child of a `<ContextMenuTrigger asChild>`. Radix's `asChild`
 * clones the child to inject its own ref and `onContextMenu`/`onPointerDown`
 * handlers, so a row that neither forwards a ref nor spreads what it is handed
 * drops every one of them and the right-click menu silently never opens.
