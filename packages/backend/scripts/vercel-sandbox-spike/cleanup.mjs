/**
 * SAFE cleanup for the migration tooling. This runs against the REAL eva /
 * Evalucom Vercel project, so it must NEVER touch resources it did not create:
 *
 *  - Sandboxes: deletes ONLY those tagged `managedBy: "eva-migration-tooling"`
 *    (set by spike.mjs / carepulse-seed.mjs). Untagged sandboxes are left alone.
 *  - Snapshots: NOT deleted by default (they have no tags in the API, so they
 *    can't be safely filtered, and the seeded snapshot is usually the deliverable).
 *    Pass explicit ids via CLEANUP_SNAPSHOT_IDS="snap_a,snap_b" to delete specific ones.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node cleanup.mjs                      # delete only tooling-tagged sandboxes
 *   CLEANUP_SNAPSHOT_IDS=snap_x node cleanup.mjs   # + delete those specific snapshots
