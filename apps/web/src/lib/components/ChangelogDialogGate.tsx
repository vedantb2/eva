 * Decides whether the changelog dialog is needed before its code is fetched.

 * roughly 930 kB gzip of JS. A `lazy()` import alone does not help when the component
 * is mounted on every page: React requests the chunk immediately and the dialog only
 * then discovers it has nothing to show. Running the (already reactive, already cached)
 * `getLatestChangelog` query out here means the chunk is fetched on the rare load that
 * actually has an unread entry.
